## How It's Made:

One of my first ever JS projects, the classic Tic-Tac-Toe. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.codebrainer.com/blog/tic-tac-toe-javascript-game), which taught me the process of breaking down the project into multiple pieces to tackle one at a time.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Skills Learned/Used**
Flex Grid
Event Listeners
Array Methods
Loops
Conditionals

## Other Projects:
